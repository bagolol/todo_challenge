# Todo Challenge

core user stories:

```
[x] As a forgetful person
    I want to store my tasks
    So that I don't forget them

[x] As a person with limited time
    I want to instantly be able to update my todo list (adding and changing entries)
    So that I have more time to think about other things

[x] As a person who actually gets stuff done
    I want to mark my tasks as done
    So that I don't do them twice
    ```

[x] As a person with a lot of tasks
    I want to be able to filter my tasks by "All", "Active", "Complete"
    So that I only see the relevant tasks

[x] As a person who doesn't like counting by hand
    I want to see a total number of tasks
    So that I don't have to count

[x] As someone who has done lots of stuff
    I want to be able to clear my completed tasks
    So I never see them again
```

### Frameworks and languages used

* Production - AngularJS, Javascript, basic Bootstrap, HTML
* Testing - Karma, Jasmine, Protractor

## Test coverage

Read the `.travis.yml` if any of the steps below don't make sense!

* Make sure you have set up `npm test` in your `package.json` so that it runs your Karma tests
* Make sure you have your Protractor config file at `e2e/conf.js`

Good luck!
